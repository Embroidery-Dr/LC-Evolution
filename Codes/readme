The graphwave algorithm is implemented through the Karate Club library.
Running the graphwave algorithm on all nodes takes about 4-5 hours (test data about a few minutes). 
The nodes are input together instead of separately when performing graph embedding for all nodes. Therefore, the test data is only used to debug the algorithm.
